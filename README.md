## 📌 Overview  
**Ancient Script Decoder** is an AI-powered system that recognizes **Egyptian hieroglyphs** from scanned images and translates them into **English** using a deep learning model trained on curated hieroglyph datasets.

Upload an image → Crop a symbol → The AI predicts top-5 matching hieroglyphs → Displays:  
- Gardiner Code  
- English meaning  
- Confidence score  

Built for researchers, students, historians, and anyone fascinated by ancient scripts.

## ✨ Features  
- 📤 Upload images containing hieroglyphs  
- ✂️ Crop/select individual symbols  
- 🤖 AI model predicts Top-5 matches  
- 🏷️ Shows Gardiner code + English meaning  
- 📊 Displays confidence score for each prediction  
- ⚡ Smooth React + Python integration  
- 🔍 Fast similarity search using embeddings
